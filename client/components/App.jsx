      <h1>Card Draw Calculator</h1>
      <p>in here should be a component which is the form for the inputs for calculation.</p>
      <p>when i get fancier i can have lots of optional inputs.</p>
      <p>the buttons which trigger the calculations should probably happen via a redux store, which while not needed for the basic front end idea, would be needed for saving previous calculations in a db</p>
